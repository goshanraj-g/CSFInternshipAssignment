personal review about vehicles. This application is built with the **MERN** stack and designed to meet all requirements of the Canadian Sheep Federation Internship Assignment

# How Can the Application and API be Extended and Improved?

- User Authentication
  - Adding login support with Google OAuth would allow it so individuals can manage their own feedback, and possibly avoid spam.
  - Allow users to view their personal feedback history, edit it, delete it
- Enhanced Filtering and Browsing
  - Add filters and search functionalities for vehicles
  - Add Make / Model / Year / Rating filters
  - Allow full-text search on comments
  - Sort by highest-rated, most reviewed, etc...
- Pagination
  - Load feedback entries 10 at a time to improve website performance and reduce frontend load time
- Ratings Aggregations/Visuals
  - Display aggregated data such as average rating per model/year or number of reviews that were submitted
- Image Integration
  - Instead of just linking a Google Images Link, I could implement an auto-fetching car API or even use Unsplash API or Car Imagery API
  - Show a live thumbnail preview in the splashcard as users adding feedback to ensure they are reviewing the right car
- Responsive UI
  - I could have improved the mobile interface by optimizing font sizes, and using mobile-friendly dropdowns
- Improved Input Validation
  - Possibly validate incoming request bodies using a library like express-validator
- Rate Limiting & Bot Prevention
  - Prevent abuse/spam using reCAPTCHA, or express-rate-limit
  - Could implement it so theres a limit of 5 submissions per minute per IP

# How Can the Application and API be Deployed?

- Backend Deployment
  - The Express API can be reployed on Render or Railway
  - The environmental variables have to be set securely on the dashboard
  - Example: `https://carma-api.onrender.com/api/feedback`
- Frontend Deployment
  - Host the React app with Vercel, GitHub Pages or Netlify
  - This could be automatically built and deployed from GitHub using CI/CD
- Database Hosting
  - MongoDB Atlas could be utilized to host a secure, scalable cloud database
  - Can be securely connected with a connection string in the backend .env
- Other Future Improvements with Deployment
  - Add domain name (carma.ca/carma.app) and link the frontend + backend with the same subdomain
  - Enable HTTPS with automatic SSL
